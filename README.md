A project I worked on during my time at Tesla Works. It was a combined effort between Tesla Works and Gopher Motors, with the hope of creating a display for Gopher Motor's vehicle.

Through pair programming, I and another individual created the functionality in DisplayDriver.ino. This program was to handle information sent over a CAN network and parse the information, which would then be displayed.
